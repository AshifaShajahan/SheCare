### Project Description
Our aim with **SheCare** is to create an all-in-one wellness platform that empowers women to take control of their health. We strive to provide personalized menstrual cycle tracking, relevant product recommendations, and a supportive AI chatbot, helping women better understand and manage their menstrual well-being.

### The Problem statement
The problem that led to the creation of **SheCare** stems from the lack of integrated solutions for menstrual health that cater to women‚Äôs unique needs. Many existing tools are fragmented, offering either cycle tracking, product recommendations, or health support, but not in a cohesive, personalized manner. Women often struggle to find reliable, tailored resources for menstrual management, and the lack of intelligent, supportive tools makes it harder to track, understand, and address menstrual health effectively. **SheCare** aims to solve these challenges by bringing together tracking, recommendations, and AI-driven assistance into one platform.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing "SheCare: The Menstrual Mastermind"!
<br>SheCare will:

Track your menstrual cycle like a psychic üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Suggest products that somehow know exactly what you need (because we‚Äôve got magic powers). üîÆ
Chat with you in a way that makes you feel like you‚Äôre talking to a friend who actually cares. (Not just an AI pretending.) üí¨
