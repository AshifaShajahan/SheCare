### Project Description
Our aim with **SheCare** is to create an all-in-one wellness platform that empowers women to take control of their health. We strive to provide personalized menstrual cycle tracking, relevant product recommendations, and a supportive AI chatbot, helping women better understand and manage their menstrual well-being.

### The Problem statement
Let’s be real—menstrual health is already so easy to manage, right? I mean, who doesn’t love juggling a dozen apps just to track a cycle, hunt for random product recommendations, and pretend that an AI chatbot actually gets it? It’s not like women deserve a simple, unified solution that actually gets their needs. Why not keep everything scattered and confusing?<br>
Oh wait, that’s exactly why SheCare was created. Because we thought, "Hey, how about we throw all that nonsense out the window and build something that actually makes sense?" A platform that tracks cycles, recommends products like we’re reading your mind, and even provides a chatbot that isn’t just there to annoy you with useless info. You’re welcome. 🙄✨

### The Solution 
Introducing "SheCare: The Menstrual Mastermind"!
<br>SheCare will:

- Track your menstrual cycle like a psychic 🧙‍♀️.<br>
- Suggest products that somehow know exactly what you need (because we’ve got magic powers). 🔮<br>
- Chat with you in a way that makes you feel like you’re talking to a friend who actually cares. (Not just an AI pretending.) 💬
